# Coverage reports

When creating a Python package, it can be very useful to know what part of your code is covered by the tests.

We recommend using [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which extends the [pytest](./python-testing.md) suite with a coverage report of your package.

We add to the `addopts` section of the `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` table of [pyproject.toml](#content:pyproject):
```toml
addopts = [
    # Other options
    "--cov=mypackage",
    "--cov-report=html",
    "--cov-report=term-missing",
    "-v"]
```

We use Github Actions to upload the coverage report as an artifact after executing the tests. We add the following step
```yaml
      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m pytest

      - name: Upload coverage report as artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: code-coverage-report
          path: htmlcov
          if-no-files-found: error
```
