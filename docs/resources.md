# Resources

There are a few very good online guides on reproducible research.

- [The Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) from the [Alan Turing institute](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute). This page contains information and guidelines about most of the things you need to know about reproducible research and we encourage everyone to skim through this site. They also have a [template repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/reproducible-project-template) that might be relevant.

- [Scientific Python](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/) is a guide on how to develop scientific software in Python. This guide is a bit more technical than the Turing way and is more focused on the software development part.

- [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) is a project that aims to teach researchers how to write better code. They have a lot of good resources and workshops that you can attend.

- [Sigma2 training](https://www.sigma2.no/training-and-events) is a Norwegian project that provides training in high performance computing and data management. They have links to a lot of good resources.

- [Papers with code](https://github.com/paperswithcode) which is probably more targeted machine learning projects. The also have a pretty comprehensive guide at https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code.

- [Reproducible Machine Learning Workflows for Scientists with Pixi](https://matthewfeickert-talks.github.io/reproducible-ml-for-scientists-with-pixi-scipy-2025/) is practical introduction to using Pixi to easily create scientific and AI/ML environments

Getting inspiration from other project is often a good way. Papers with code also has a [web page](https://paperswithcode.com) where you can search for papers with code. For example you, could try to [search for FEniCS](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FEniCS) and you will get a list of projects where FEniCS is mentioned.
