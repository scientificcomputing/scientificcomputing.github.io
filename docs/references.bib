  abstract      = {Directional fluid flow in perivascular spaces surrounding cerebral arteries is hypothesized to play a key role in brain solute transport and clearance. While various drivers for a pulsatile flow, such as cardiac or respiratory pulsations, are well quantified, the question remains as to which mechanisms could induce a directional flow within physiological regimes. To address this question, we develop theoretical and numerical reduced-order models to quantify the directional (net) flow induceable by peristaltic pumping in periarterial networks. Each periarterial element is modeled as a slender annular space bounded internally by a circular tube supporting a periodic traveling (peristaltic) wave. Under reasonable assumptions of a small Reynolds number flow, small radii, and small-amplitude peristaltic waves, we use lubrication theory and regular perturbation methods to derive theoretical expressions for the directional net flow and pressure distribution in the perivascular network. The reduced model is used to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the net flow for simple network configurations of interest, including single elements, two elements in tandem, and a three element bifurcation, with results compared with numerical predictions. In particular, we provide a computable theoretical estimate of the net flow induced by peristaltic motion in perivascular networks as a function of physiological parameters, notably, wave length, frequency, amplitude, and perivascular dimensions. Quantifying the maximal net flow for specific physiological regimes, we find that vasomotion may induce net pial periarterial flow velocities on the order of a few to tens of   \ensuremath{\mu}m/s and that sleep-related changes in vasomotion pulsatility may drive a threefold flow increase.},

Although currently available benchmarks contain some of the features that cardiac mechanics models typically include, some important modeling aspects are missing. Therefore, we propose a new set of cardiac benchmark problems and solutions for assessing passive and active material behavior, viscous effects, and pericardial boundary condition. The problems proposed include simplified analytical fiber definitions and active stress models on a monoventricular and biventricular domains, allowing straightforward testing and validation with already developed solvers.}

  abstract      = {Abstract Individually personalized computational models of heart mechanics can be used to estimate important physiological and clinically-relevant quantities that are difficult, if not impossible, to directly measure in the beating heart. Here, we present a novel and efficient framework for creating patient-specific biventricular models using a gradient-based data assimilation method for evaluating regional myocardial contractility and estimating myofiber stress. These simulations can be performed on a regular laptop in less than 2~h and produce excellent fit between measured and simulated volume and strain data through the entire cardiac cycle. By applying the framework using data obtained from 3 healthy human biventricles, we extracted clinically important quantities as well as explored the role of fiber angles on heart function. Our results show that steep fiber angles at the endocardium and epicardium are required to produce simulated motion compatible with measured strain and volume data. We also find that the contraction and subsequent systolic stresses in the right ventricle are significantly lower than that in the left ventricle. Variability of the estimated quantities with respect to both patient data and modeling choices are also found to be low. Because of its high efficiency, this framework may be applicable to modeling of patient specific cardiac mechanics for diagnostic purposes.},

  abstract      = {Background Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) like empagliflozin have demonstrated cardioprotective effects in patients with or without diabetes. SGLT2is have been shown to selectively inhibit the late component of cardiac sodium current (late INa). Induction of late INa is the primary mechanism in the pathophysiology of congenital long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) gain-of-function mutations in the SCN5A gene encoding Nav1.5. We investigated empagliflozin's effect on late INa in thirteen known LQT3 mutations located in distinct regions of the channel. Methods The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to investigate the effect of empagliflozin on late INa in recombinantly expressed Nav1.5 channels containing different LQT3 mutations. Molecular modeling of human Nav1.5 and simulations in a mathematical model of human ventricular myocytes were used to extrapolate our experimental results to excitation-contraction coupling. Results Empagliflozin selectively inhibited late INa in LQT3 mutations in the inactivation gate region of Nav1.5, without affecting peak current or channel kinetics. In contrast, empagliflozin inhibited both peak and late INa in mutations in the S4 voltage-sensing regions, altered channel gating, and slowed recovery from inactivation. Empagliflozin had no effect on late/peak INa or channel kinetics in channels with mutations in the putative empagliflozin binding region. Simulation results predict that empagliflozin may have a desirable therapeutic effect in LQT3 mutations in the inactivation gate region. Conclusions Empagliflozin selectively inhibits late INa, without affecting channel kinetics, in LQT3 mutations in the inactivation gate region. Empagliflozin may thus be a promising precision medicine approach for patients with specific LQT3 mutations.}
