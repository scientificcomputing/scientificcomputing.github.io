# Badges

## Binder
To get the `Launch Binder` badge, go to: [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/) and fill in (specifics for this repo in brackets):

Then press `Launch`, and then `Expand to see the text below, paste it into your README to show a Binder badge` and copy the markdown code. If you render the README.md file as plaintext, you can see all the settings explicitly in the image link

Binder requires you to have a configuration file describing your environment in the root of your Github repo, see [Binder - Configuration files](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/config_files.html) for more information.
