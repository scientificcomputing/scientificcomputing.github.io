# Overview

We think reproducibility is important and we have created some guidelines for reproducible research.

On this web-page we discuss what is needed when you want to publish a paper that contains some code, and we are created two example papers that follows these guidelines

- [Simple example paper](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-paper)
- [Example paper using FEniCS](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-paper-fenics)
- [Example Python Package](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-python-package/)

We provide repositories that can generate a repository structure automatically by using [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

- [Generate Paper](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/generate-paper/)
- [Generate Python Package](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/generate-python-package/)
