# Making reproducible research

We think reproducibility is important and we have created some guidelines for reproducible research.

At <https://scientificcomputing.github.io/paper-with-code/> we discuss what is needed when you want to publish a paper that contains some code, and we are created two example papers that follows these guidelines

- [Simple example paper](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-paper)
- [Example paper using FEniCS](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-paper-fenics)


There are several tools that are useful when developing reproducible research and we have gather the tools that we believe are most important at <https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/>.

If you want to create a software package based on Python, we recommend using our [template-repo](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/template-repo/) to generate a template for the software with the tools described at <https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/>.


# Initializing an existing repo as a Github repository
See [Adding a locally hosted code to Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github) for more information.
