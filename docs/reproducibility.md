# Overview

We think reproducibility is important and we have created some guidelines for reproducible research.

On this web-page we discuss what is needed when you want to publish a paper that contains some code, and we are created two example papers that follows these guidelines

- [Simple example paper](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-paper)
- [Example paper using FEniCS](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-paper-fenics)
- [Example Python Package](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/example-python-package/)

If you want to create a software package based on Python, we recommend using our [python-package-template](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/template-repo/) to generate a shell structure for your Python package
