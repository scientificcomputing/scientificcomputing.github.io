# Packages
Github Packages is an integrated feature, which can link a repository to a set of [Docker images](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container-image) and a large variety of [other formats](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry).

See [Publishing to Github Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-github-packages) for more information.

You can choose if the image is public or private, see [Access control](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility) for more information.

## DockerHub
There are [Github workflows](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/gh-workflows.html#workflows) for [publishing to DockerHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-docker-hub).
